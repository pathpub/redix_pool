# RedixPool

Simple Redis pooling built on [redix](https://github.com/whatyouhide/redix) and [poolboy](https://github.com/devinus/poolboy).

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `redix_pool` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:redix_pool, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```

## Configuration

`RedixPool` currently only supports a few basic configuration options:

```elixir
# myapp/config/config.exs
use Mix.Config

config :redix_pool,
  redis_url: "redis://localhost:6379",
  pool_size: {:system, "POOL_SIZE"}, # System.get_env("POOL_SIZE") will be executed at runtime
  pool_max_overflow: 1
```

## Basic Usage

`RedixPool` supports `command/2` and `pipeline/2` (and their bang variants), which are just like the `Redix` `command/3` and `pipeline/3` functions, except `RedixPool` handles the connection for you.

This means using `command` is as simple as:

```elixir
alias RedixPool, as: Redis

Redis.command(["FLUSHDB"])
#=> {:ok, "OK"}

Redis.command(["SET", "foo", "bar"])
#=> {:ok, "OK"}

Redis.command(["GET", "foo"])
#=> {:ok, "bar"}
```

## Testing

Currently, the tests assume you have an instance of Redis running locally at `localhost:6379`.

On OSX, Redis can be installed easily with `MacPorts` or `brew`:

```bash
sudo port install redis
```

```bash
brew install redis
```

Once you have Redis running, simply run `mix test`.
